Some things can’t be explained. According to a peasant’s notions, schoolboys are whipped, and must be whipped. What would a schoolboy be if he were not whipped? And if I were to tell him we are not, he’d be disappointed. But you don’t understand that. One has to know how to talk to the peasants.”</p><p>“Only don’t tease them, please, or you’ll get into another scrape as you did about that goose.”</p></div> </div>
