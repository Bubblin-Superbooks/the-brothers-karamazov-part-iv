Some people are low from self‐ interest, but he’s simply so, from nature. Only fancy, he claims (he was arguing about it all the way yesterday) that Gogol wrote Dead Souls about him. Do you remember, there’s a landowner called Maximov in it, whom Nozdryov thrashed.

He couldn’t have been thrashed then, he couldn’t, could he?”</p></div> </div>
