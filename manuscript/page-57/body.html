You didn’t sleep all night either, I hear, you had a meeting in there. And then all this bobbery afterwards. Most likely you’ve had nothing to eat but a mouthful of holy bread. I’ve got some sausage in my pocket; I’ve brought it from the town in case of need, only you won’t eat sausage....”</p><p>“Give me some.”</p><p>“I say! You are going it! Why, it’s a regular mutiny, with barricades! Well, my boy, we must make the most of it. Come to my place.... I shouldn’t mind a drop of vodka myself, I am tired to death. Vodka is going too far for you, I suppose ... or would you like some?”</p></div> </div>
