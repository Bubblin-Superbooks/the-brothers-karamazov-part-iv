Write that I should think it dishonorable to say. Ech! you can write it; you’ve nothing else to do with your time.”</p><p>“Allow me to caution you, sir, and to remind you once more, if you are unaware of it,” the prosecutor began, with a peculiar and stern impressiveness, “that you have a perfect right not to answer the questions put to you now, and we on our side have no right to extort an answer from you, if you decline to give it for one reason or another. That is entirely a matter for your personal decision.

After which I will beg you to continue.”</p></div> </div>
