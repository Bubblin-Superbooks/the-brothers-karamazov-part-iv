It must have been his wife that ruined him; you know he threw me up to get married. She must have changed him like that. Mitya, how shameful it is! Oh, Mitya, I’m ashamed, I’m ashamed for all my life. Curse it, curse it, curse those five years!”</p><p>And again she burst into tears, but clung tight to Mitya’s hand and did not let it go.</p><p>“Mitya, darling, stay, don’t go away.
