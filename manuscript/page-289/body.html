And it was three thousand he talked about ...”</p><p>Pyotr Ilyitch listened. All at once he became short and dry in his answers.

But by the end of the third game, Pyotr Ilyitch felt no more desire for billiards; he laid down the cue, and without having supper as he had intended, he walked out of the tavern.
