And I should have thought that there was no need for a sensible man to speak of it again.”</p><p>“But why, why had you such a suspicion about me at the time?”</p><p>“As you know already, it was simply from fear. For I was in such a position, shaking with fear, that I suspected every one. I resolved to sound you, too, for I thought if you wanted the same as your brother, then the business was as good as settled and I should be crushed like a fly, too.”</p></div> </div>
