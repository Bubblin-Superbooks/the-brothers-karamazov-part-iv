He has known about him from the very beginning, but to‐day he suddenly got up and began scolding about him. I am ashamed to repeat what he said. Silly fellow! Rakitin went in as I came out. Perhaps Rakitin is egging him on. What do you think?” she added carelessly.</p><p>“He loves you, that’s what it is: he loves you so much. And now he is particularly worried.”</p><p>“I should think he might be, with the trial to‐morrow. And I went to him to say something about to‐morrow, for I dread to think what’s going to happen then. You say that he is worried, but how worried I am! And he talks about the Pole! He’s too silly! He is not jealous of Maximushka yet, anyway.”</p></div> </div>
