<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Chapter I. The Fatal Day</p><p>At ten oâ€™clock in the morning of the day following the events I have described, the trial of Dmitri Karamazov began in our district court.</p><p>I hasten to emphasize the fact that I am far from esteeming myself capable of reporting all that took place at the trial in full detail, or even in the actual order of events. I imagine that to mention everything with full explanation would fill a volume, even a very large one. And so I trust I may not be reproached, for confining myself to what struck me. I may have selected as of most interest what was of secondary importance, and may have omitted the most prominent and essential details. But I see I shall do better not to apologize. I will do my best and the reader will see for himself that I have done all I can.</p></div> </div>
