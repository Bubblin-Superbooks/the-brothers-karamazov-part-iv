Grushenka snatched the letter from her and carried it to the candle. It was only a note, a few lines. She read it in one instant.</p><p>“He has sent for me,” she cried, her face white and distorted, with a wan smile; “he whistles! Crawl back, little dog!”</p><p>But only for one instant she stood as though hesitating; suddenly the blood rushed to her head and sent a glow to her cheeks.</p><p>“I will go,” she cried; “five years of my life! Good‐by! Good‐by, Alyosha, my fate is sealed. Go, go, leave me all of you, don’t let me see you again! Grushenka is flying to a new life.... Don’t you remember evil against me either, Rakitin. I may be going to my death! Ugh! I feel as though I were drunk!”</p></div> </div>
