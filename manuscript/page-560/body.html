I know he wouldn’t lie to me. I saw from his face he wasn’t lying.”</p><p>“Only from his face? Is that all the proof you have?”</p><p>“I have no other proof.”</p><p>“And of Smerdyakov’s guilt you have no proof whatever but your brother’s word and the expression of his face?”</p><p>“No, I have no other proof.”</p><p>The prosecutor dropped the examination at this point. The impression left by Alyosha’s evidence on the public was most disappointing. There had been talk about Smerdyakov before the trial; some one had heard something, some one had pointed out something else, it was said that Alyosha had gathered together some extraordinary proofs of his brother’s innocence and Smerdyakov’s guilt, and after all there was nothing, no evidence except certain moral convictions so natural in a brother.</p></div> </div>
