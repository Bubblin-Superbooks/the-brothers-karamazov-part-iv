<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I’ve got it at home in the town,” faltered Mitya, his spirit sinking at every word he uttered. “Upon my word, the money’s there, hidden.”</p><p>In an instant an extraordinary sense of personal dignity showed itself in the little man’s face.</p><p>“What next?” he asked ironically. “For shame!” and he spat on the floor. Pan Vrublevsky spat too.</p><p>“You do that, panie,” said Mitya, recognizing with despair that all was over, “because you hope to make more out of Grushenka? You’re a couple of capons, that’s what you are!”</p><p>“This is a mortal insult!” The little Pole turned as red as a crab, and he went out of the room, briskly, as though unwilling to hear another word. Vrublevsky swung out after him, and Mitya followed, confused and crestfallen. He was afraid of Grushenka, afraid that the pan would at once raise an outcry. And so indeed he did. The Pole walked into the room and threw himself in a theatrical attitude before Grushenka.</p></div> </div>
