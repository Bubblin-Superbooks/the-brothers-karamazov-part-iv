<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Such gentlemen of accommodating temper and dependent position, who can tell a story, take a hand at cards, and who have a distinct aversion for any duties that may be forced upon them, are usually solitary creatures, either bachelors or widowers. Sometimes they have children, but if so, the children are always being brought up at a distance, at some aunt’s, to whom these gentlemen never allude in good society, seeming ashamed of the relationship. They gradually lose sight of their children altogether, though at intervals they receive a birthday or Christmas letter from them and sometimes even answer it.</p><p>The countenance of the unexpected visitor was not so much good‐natured, as accommodating and ready to assume any amiable expression as occasion might arise. He had no watch, but he had a tortoise‐shell lorgnette on a black ribbon.</p></div> </div>
