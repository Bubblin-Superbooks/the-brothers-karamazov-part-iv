He must have killed his old father!” she cried, clasping her hands. “I have never given him money, never! Oh, run, run!... Don’t say another word! Save the old man ... run to his father ... run!”</p><p>“Excuse me, madam, then you did not give him money? You remember for a fact that you did not give him any money?”</p><p>“No, I didn’t, I didn’t! I refused to give it him, for he could not appreciate it. He ran out in a fury, stamping. He rushed at me, but I slipped away.... And let me tell you, as I wish to hide nothing from you now, that he positively spat at me. Can you fancy that! But why are we standing? Ah, sit down.”</p></div> </div>
