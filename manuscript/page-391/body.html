I could reckon upon that.”</p><p>“But what if he did not kill him, but only knocked him down?”</p><p>“If he did not kill him, of course, I would not have ventured to take the money, and nothing would have happened. But I calculated that he would beat him senseless, and I should have time to take it then, and then I’d make out to Fyodor Pavlovitch that it was no one but Dmitri Fyodorovitch who had taken the money after beating him.”</p></div> </div>
