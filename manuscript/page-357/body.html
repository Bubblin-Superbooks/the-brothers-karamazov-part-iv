There’s money for you,” he pulled out his notes. “Would you like three thousand? Take it and go your way.”</p><p>The Pole gazed open‐eyed at Mitya, with a searching look.</p><p>“Three thousand, panie?” He exchanged glances with Vrublevsky.</p><p>“Three, panovie, three! Listen, panie, I see you’re a sensible man. Take three thousand and go to the devil, and Vrublevsky with you—d’you hear? But, at once, this very minute, and for ever. You understand that, panie, for ever. Here’s the door, you go out of it. What have you got there, a great‐coat, a fur coat? I’ll bring it out to you. They’ll get the horses out directly, and then—good‐by, panie!”</p></div> </div>
