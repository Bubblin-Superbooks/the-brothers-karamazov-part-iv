<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For in the past, monks of very holy life had died, God‐fearing old men, whose saintliness was acknowledged by all, yet from their humble coffins, too, the breath of corruption had come, naturally, as from all dead bodies, but that had caused no scandal nor even the slightest excitement. Of course there had been, in former times, saints in the monastery whose memory was carefully preserved and whose relics, according to tradition, showed no signs of corruption. This fact was regarded by the monks as touching and mysterious, and the tradition of it was cherished as something blessed and miraculous, and as a promise, by God’s grace, of still greater glory from their tombs in the future.</p><p>One such, whose memory was particularly cherished, was an old monk, Job, who had died seventy years before at the age of a hundred and five.</p></div> </div>
