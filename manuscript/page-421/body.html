<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Some one appeared to be sitting there, though goodness knows how he had come in, for he had not been in the room when Ivan came into it, on his return from Smerdyakov. This was a person or, more accurately speaking, a Russian gentleman of a particular kind, no longer young, qui faisait la cinquantaine, as the French say, with rather long, still thick, dark hair, slightly streaked with gray and a small pointed beard. He was wearing a brownish reefer jacket, rather shabby, evidently made by a good tailor though, and of a fashion at least three years old, that had been discarded by smart and well‐to‐do people for the last two years. His linen and his long scarf‐like neck‐tie were all such as are worn by people who aim at being stylish, but on closer inspection his linen was not over‐clean and his wide scarf was very threadbare.</p></div> </div>
