Ici, Perezvon.” And Kolya began giving orders to the dog, who performed all his tricks.</p><p>He was a rough‐haired dog, of medium size, with a coat of a sort of lilac‐ gray color. He was blind in his right eye, and his left ear was torn. He whined and jumped, stood and walked on his hind legs, lay on his back with his paws in the air, rigid as though he were dead. While this last performance was going on, the door opened and Agafya, Madame Krassotkin’s servant, a stout woman of forty, marked with small‐pox, appeared in the doorway. She had come back from market and had a bag full of provisions in her hand. Holding up the bag of provisions in her left hand she stood still to watch the dog.</p></div> </div>
