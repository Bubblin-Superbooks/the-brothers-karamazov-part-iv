Ach!” He suddenly clutched his head in both hands.</p><p>“Listen. Did you kill him alone? With my brother’s help or without?”</p><p>“It was only with you, with your help, I killed him, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch is quite innocent.”</p><p>“All right, all right. Talk about me later. Why do I keep on trembling? I can’t speak properly.”</p><p>“You were bold enough then.

Only I must hide this first.”</p></div> </div>
