I’m in a hurry, Pyotr Ilyitch, please make haste.”</p><p>Pyotr Ilyitch grew more and more surprised; he suddenly caught sight of a bundle of bank‐notes in Mitya’s hand, and what was more, he had walked in holding the notes as no one walks in and no one carries money: he had them in his right hand, and held them outstretched as if to show them. Perhotin’s servant‐boy, who met Mitya in the passage, said afterwards that he walked into the passage in the same way, with the money outstretched in his hand, so he must have been carrying them like that even in the streets. They were all rainbow‐colored hundred‐rouble notes, and the fingers holding them were covered with blood.</p></div> </div>
