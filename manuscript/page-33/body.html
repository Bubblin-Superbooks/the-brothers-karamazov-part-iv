He was not shaken by it, but awaited what would come next without fear, watching with penetration and insight for the outcome of the general excitement.</p><p>Suddenly an extraordinary uproar in the passage in open defiance of decorum burst on his ears. The door was flung open and Father Ferapont appeared in the doorway. Behind him there could be seen accompanying him a crowd of monks, together with many people from the town. They did not, however, enter the cell, but stood at the bottom of the steps, waiting to see what Father Ferapont would say or do.</p></div> </div>
