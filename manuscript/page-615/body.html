<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mitya got up, moved from his chair to the corner by the curtain, lay down on a large chest covered with a rug, and instantly fell asleep.</p><p>He had a strange dream, utterly out of keeping with the place and the time.</p><p>He was driving somewhere in the steppes, where he had been stationed long ago, and a peasant was driving him in a cart with a pair of horses, through snow and sleet. He was cold, it was early in November, and the snow was falling in big wet flakes, melting as soon as it touched the earth. And the peasant drove him smartly, he had a fair, long beard. He was not an old man, somewhere about fifty, and he had on a gray peasantâ€™s smock. Not far off was a village, he could see the black huts, and half the huts were burnt down, there were only the charred beams sticking up.</p></div> </div>
