I remember that among other things he asked about Rakitin and the twenty‐five roubles “you paid him for bringing Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov to see you.”</p><p>“There was nothing strange about his taking the money,” sneered Grushenka, with angry contempt. “He was always coming to me for money: he used to get thirty roubles a month at least out of me, chiefly for luxuries: he had enough to keep him without my help.”</p><p>“What led you to be so liberal to Mr. Rakitin?” Fetyukovitch asked, in spite of an uneasy movement on the part of the President.</p><p>“Why, he is my cousin. His mother was my mother’s sister. But he’s always besought me not to tell any one here of it, he is so dreadfully ashamed of me.”</p></div> </div>
