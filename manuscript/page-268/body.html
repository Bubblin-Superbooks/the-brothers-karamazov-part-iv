<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Misha ran in, post‐haste, with a handful of notes in change, and reported that every one was in a bustle at the Plotnikovs’; “They’re carrying down the bottles, and the fish, and the tea; it will all be ready directly.” Mitya seized ten roubles and handed it to Pyotr Ilyitch, then tossed another ten‐rouble note to Misha.</p><p>“Don’t dare to do such a thing!” cried Pyotr Ilyitch. “I won’t have it in my house, it’s a bad, demoralizing habit. Put your money away. Here, put it here, why waste it? It would come in handy to‐morrow, and I dare say you’ll be coming to me to borrow ten roubles again. Why do you keep putting the notes in your side‐pocket? Ah, you’ll lose them!”</p></div> </div>
