It is now vitally important for us to know exactly why you needed that sum, I mean precisely three thousand.”</p><p>“Why I needed it?... Oh, for one thing and another.... Well, it was to pay a debt.”</p><p>“A debt to whom?”</p><p>“That I absolutely refuse to answer, gentlemen. Not because I couldn’t, or because I shouldn’t dare, or because it would be damaging, for it’s all a paltry matter and absolutely trifling, but—I won’t, because it’s a matter of principle: that’s my private life, and I won’t allow any intrusion into my private life. That’s my principle. Your question has no bearing on the case, and whatever has nothing to do with the case is my private affair. I wanted to pay a debt. I wanted to pay a debt of honor but to whom I won’t say.”</p></div> </div>
