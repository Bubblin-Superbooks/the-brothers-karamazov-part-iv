She became very talkative, kept calling every one to her, and beckoned to different girls out of the chorus. When the girl came up, she either kissed her, or made the sign of the cross over her. In another minute she might have cried. She was greatly amused by the “little old man,” as she called Maximov. He ran up every minute to kiss her hands, “each little finger,” and finally he danced another dance to an old song, which he sang himself.

The hen goes strutting through the porch; Troo‐roo‐roo‐roo‐roo, she’ll say, Troo‐roo‐roo‐roo‐roo, she’ll say!</p></div> </div>
