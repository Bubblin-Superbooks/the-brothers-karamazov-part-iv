Every man may be a scoundrel, and perhaps every man is a scoundrel, but not every one can be a thief, it takes an arch‐scoundrel to be that. Oh, of course, I don’t know how to make these fine distinctions ... but a thief is lower than a scoundrel, that’s my conviction. Listen, I carry the money about me a whole month, I may make up my mind to give it back to‐morrow, and I’m a scoundrel no longer, but I cannot make up my mind, you see, though I’m making up my mind every day, and every day spurring myself on to do it, and yet for a whole month I can’t bring myself to it, you see. Is that right to your thinking, is that right?”</p></div> </div>
