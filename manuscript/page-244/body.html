That was ‘soon’! He said the child moaned, kept on moaning and he stood admiring it. That’s nice!”</p><p>“Nice?”</p><p>“Nice; I sometimes imagine that it was I who crucified him. He would hang there moaning and I would sit opposite him eating pineapple compote. I am awfully fond of pineapple compote. Do you like it?”</p></div> </div>
