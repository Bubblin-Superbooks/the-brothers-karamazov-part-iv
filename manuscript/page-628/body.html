At the gates there was a crowd of people, peasants, women and drivers. Trifon Borissovitch came down the steps too. All stared at Mitya.</p><p>“Forgive me at parting, good people!” Mitya shouted suddenly from the cart.</p><p>“Forgive us too!” he heard two or three voices.</p><p>“Good‐by to you, too, Trifon Borissovitch!”</p><p>But Trifon Borissovitch did not even turn round.

They ran to look for him. The peasant persisted and besought them to wait.</p></div> </div>
