What have I to be afraid of to‐morrow?” Ivan articulated in astonishment, and suddenly a chill breath of fear did in fact pass over his soul. Smerdyakov measured him with his eyes.</p><p>“You don’t understand?” he drawled reproachfully. “It’s a strange thing a sensible man should care to play such a farce!”</p><p>Ivan looked at him speechless. The startling, incredibly supercilious tone of this man who had once been his valet, was extraordinary in itself.
