Maximov, hearing that Grushenka wanted to dance, squealed with delight, and ran skipping about in front of her, humming:</p><p>With legs so slim and sides so trim And its little tail curled tight.</p><p>But Grushenka waved her handkerchief at him and drove him away.</p><p>“Sh‐h! Mitya, why don’t they come? Let every one come ... to look on. Call them in, too, that were locked in.... Why did you lock them in? Tell them I’m going to dance. Let them look on, too....”</p></div> </div>
