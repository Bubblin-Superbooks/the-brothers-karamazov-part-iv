Come, she’s going to dance. She calls you.”</p><p>“Lajdak!” one of the Poles shouted in reply.</p><p>“You’re a lajdak yourself! You’re a little scoundrel, that’s what you are.”</p><p>“Leave off laughing at Poland,” said Kalganov sententiously. He too was drunk.</p><p>“Be quiet, boy! If I call him a scoundrel, it doesn’t mean that I called all Poland so. One lajdak doesn’t make a Poland. Be quiet, my pretty boy, eat a sweetmeat.”</p></div> </div>
